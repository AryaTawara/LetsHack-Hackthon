# LetsHack-Hackthon

This project is a health app that allows patients to input data and check if it is normal or not. The data is measured by devices used by the patient, for example a heart rate monitor used by heart patients or a sugar level sensor used by patients that have diabetes. If the entered data is normal, no action is done. However, if the data is not normal, an email is sent to the patient's doctor which informs them that their patient is not healthy. For testing purposes, the entered data should be a number and will be considered normal if it is below 10.
