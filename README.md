# LetsHack-Hackthon

This project is a health app that allows patients to input data and check if it is normal or not. The data is measured by devices used by the patient, for exapmle a heart rate moniter used by heart patients or a sugar level sensor used by patients that have diabetes. If the entered data is normal, no action is done. However, if the data is not normal, an email is sent to the patient's doctor which informs them that their patient is not healthy. For testing purposes, the entered data should be a number and will be considered normal if it is below 10. The app also reminds patients when they need to take their medicines by in-app notifications. The timings for these are inputed by the patient inside the app.
